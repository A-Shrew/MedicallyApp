How to use github:
- Step 1: cd into a folder loction on you local machine. For example my folder path is C:\Users\brett\OneDrive\Desktop\MedicallyApp Project\MedicallyApp. To do this open a terminal and type cd "path"
- Step 2: clone the repo into that folder. To do this copy the github url from the page I think it is https://github.com/A-Shrew/MedicallyApp.git and type git clone "url" (It might ask you to sign in to github.
- Step 3: once you have done this the original folder is now linked to the github repo. Now you can copy all your files to the new folder and type git status
- Step 4: the git status command should show you added new files in red text. You then type git all --all to confirm the new files.
- Step 5: final step is to type git commit -m "description of changes" and then git push origin to upload changes to github.
